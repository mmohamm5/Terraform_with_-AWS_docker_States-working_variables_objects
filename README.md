# Terraform_with_-AWS_docker_States-working_variables_objects
Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools (Terraform) allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations you can version, reuse, and share.
